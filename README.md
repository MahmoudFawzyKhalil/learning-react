# ⚛️ Learning React
I want to learn more about frontend development. I am familiar with `JavaScript` and `Angular`, and I'd like to learn `React`.

## The main resources I am using to learn are
- The [beta React docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)
- The book [React: Up & Running, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-up/9781492051459/)
